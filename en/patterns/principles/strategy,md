### Strategy Principle

Introducing the Strategy Principle, which focuses on deliberate purpose towards achieving a desired outcome. It involves breaking big goals down into smaller achievable steps and using concepts of strategic thinking to be tactful and create opportunities for boosting.

Expanding on the idea, the Strategy Principle emphasizes the importance of having a clear and deliberate purpose when working towards achieving a goal. This involves breaking the goal down into smaller, achievable steps that can be taken to reach the desired outcome. It also involves using strategic thinking concepts to be tactful and make the most of the available resources, as well as creating opportunities for boosting to ensure that the goal is achieved in the most efficient and effective way possible.

The value of the Strategy Principle lies in its ability to help you achieve your goals in a deliberate and purposeful way. By breaking down big goals into smaller achievable steps and using strategic thinking, you can identify the most effective way to achieve your desired outcome. This can lead to increased productivity, efficiency, and overall success.

If the Strategy Principle is not followed, it can lead to a lack of direction and purpose, as well as missed opportunities for boosting and achieving your goals. Without a clear and deliberate plan, you risk wasting time and resources on actions that may not be effective in achieving your desired outcome.

The key takeaway is that the Strategy Principle is an important component of achieving success in any endeavour. By breaking big goals down into smaller achievable steps, using strategic thinking, and being deliberate and purposeful in your actions, you can achieve your desired outcomes in the most efficient and effective way possible.
